# hyperdav-server
* This library was modified to support the latest version of hyper by forking https://github.com/tylerwhall/hyperdav-server.
* The ultimate goal is to support webdav using external storage on Android and build an environment that can be tested on Windows.
  * This library does not include a UI, so when actually using it on Android, it must be used after obtaining access to a specific directory from the user.
